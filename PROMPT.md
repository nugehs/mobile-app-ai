- QR Code scanning capability using Expo's BarCode Scanner
- Secure authentication implementation

## Core Features

### 1. Authentication System
- Login screen for Event Organizers
- Secure token management
- Session persistence
- Password reset functionality
- Form validation

### 2. Event Management

- Event details view with:
  * Event name, date, time, location
  * Ticket types and pricing
  * Total tickets sold
  * Revenue statistics
- Search and filter capabilities
- Pull-to-refresh functionality

### 3. Guest Management

- Search guests by name/email
- Filter guests by ticket type
- Check-in status tracking
- Export guest list functionality

### 4. QR Code Scanner
- Fast and efficient QR code scanning
- Real-time ticket validation
- Visual and audio feedback for successful/failed scans
- Offline scanning capability

### 5. Profile Management
- Organizer profile view and edit
- Organization details
- Contact information
- Notification preferences
- App settings

## UI/UX Requirements

- Offline data persistence
- Real-time updates where necessary
- Error boundary implementation

### 3. Performance
- Fast app loading
- Optimized list rendering
- Efficient image loading
- Memory management
- Battery usage optimization for scanner

### 4. Security
- Secure data storage
- API request encryption
- Input sanitization
- Certificate pinning
- Secure scanner implementation

## Project Structure
Please organize the code following these principles:
- Feature-based organization
- Reusable components
- Custom hooks for business logic
- Proper type definitions
- Clear documentation
- Unit test setup

## Additional Requirements
